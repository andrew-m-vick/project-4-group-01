# Used Car Price Predictions

![home](images/home.png)

This project aims to predict used car prices based on features like make, model, year, mileage, etc. The goal is to provide insights to consumers and dealerships for making informed decisions about buying or selling used cars.

## Project Goals

- Develop a machine learning model to predict used car prices.
- Create an interactive dashboard to visualize and compare car prices based on various factors.
- Provide accessible and user-friendly tools for navigating the used car market.

## Data and Methodology

- Dataset: Large dataset of used car information from over 65,000 U.S. dealerships.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, Tableau.
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- Visualization: Interactive dashboard with various filters and comparisons.

## Key Findings

- Random Forest Regressor model achieved the highest accuracy (R-squared = 92.4%).
- Linear Regression model chosen for web application due to lower computational needs (R-squared = 82.3%).
- Dashboard allows users to compare car prices by make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and location.

## Limitations

- Lack of accident history and previous ownership data in the dataset.
- Time constraints limited data preprocessing efforts.
- Model accuracy impacted by large dataset size and complexity.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed a machine learning model and dashboard to predict used car prices. The tool provides valuable insights for consumers and dealerships, enabling data-driven decisions in the used car market. Despite limitations, the project provides a foundation for further refinement and serves as a useful resource for navigating the used car market.
